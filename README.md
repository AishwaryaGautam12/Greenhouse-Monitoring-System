# Greenhouse-Monitoring-System
The aim of this project is to design a greenhouse monitoring system based on the Internet of things (IOT). A greenhouse is a covered area where plants grow and cultivate. It is also known as land of controlled crops and plants. There are some important parameters to be monitored inside the greenhouse are temperature, relative humidity and carbon-di-oxide. 

## Motivation
The recent scenario of climate change and its effect on the environment has motivated the farmers to install greenhouses in their fields. But maintaining a greenhouse and its plantation is very labour intensive. Majority of the farmers perform vital operations intuitively. Also agricultural researchers are facing shortage of good quality of data which is crucial for crop development. Thus we  have developed such a cost effective system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology which is focused on solving these particular problems. Our system automates the greenhouse maintenance operations and monitors the growth conditions inside the greenhouse closely.
